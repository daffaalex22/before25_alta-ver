## More
The project implements CRUD to Hasura API using GraphQL queries. Some data are processed by the Frontend (e.g. Search). The filter part on the '/admin' page are probably the most annoying one to work on at the time because some weird behaviour of Material UI's Autocomplete Textfield Component. The app uses WYSIWYG Text Editor so it can store HTML on the Backend. It easily deployed using Netlify for free.
